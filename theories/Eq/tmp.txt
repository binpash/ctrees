I'm sure you already did it by building these slides, but I always like to condense the message of the talk into a one slide amount of content so that we know what we aim for. I feel like that would be in this case the following:
Messages you want to share:
Context:
- Layered monadic interpreters are great,
- but when applied at scale, they raise new challenges.
Advertisement: with this work, you solve two majors ones by providing the adequate formal framework
- New tools to reduce the boilerplate in defining such interpreters
- New tools to reduce the boilerplate in building the necessary meta-theory to conduct formal reasoning about them
- You deliver as a Coq library, extending the itree framework

So I think slide 2 you want to incrementally convey:
(1) An interesting way to model a programming language in a proof assistant such as Coq is via a monadic definitional interpreter: programs are computations
(2) Lots of work has taught us that this can even be fruitfully structured: setting things in an extensible way, leading to both algebraic and Hoare-style reasoning, and suited for formalization (front-loading therefore your related work)
(3) But at scale, boilerplate and complexity arises: with this work, you provide novel tools in Coq to lighten greatly reasoning on these layered interpreters at scale.

At this point you have at a very high level your context and contribution. We now need to make a bit more concrete what the construction of these monadic interpreters look like, and why they are layered.
I think slide 3 is quite good to move onto this, although I would be strongly tempted to remove completely the Coq code on it. But in exchange to insist quite heavily on the fact that this is essentially a syntax.
Note: I think you want to put "Free" instead of "M" at the bottom

Then as you mentioned in note, I think indeed that slide 4 and 6 overlap quite a bit in intent. I think it would be a good idea to trash slide 4, and move 6 right now, but I would try the following maybe.
- First have on the slide only two layers, the very simple program you have currently, and go from "syntax" to "Free EnvE" to "stateT env (Free void)". Maybe if you want to be fancy have a tiny tree to the right of the first layer, and a tiny "m \mapsto a linear tree" to the right of the second ?
- But then second enrich the program with maybe a `store x` or something like that to explain "ok but now if we have another effect that the environment, things get more interesting". And enrich in the transition things with a `MemoryE` and a third layer.
- And there at this point pause to explain the benefits of having layered things this way, rather than directly interpreted from the first layer to the third in one go: more modular, simpler reasoning at intermediate level, dependencies between effects, ...

Now I think you might want to still cover one thing on this slide: this is great and all, but let's spell out what this means.
- You have three levels, three monads, and to benefit from being able to reason at each level, you need an equational theory at each level: some of it is specific to the effect, but some is generic. Can we avoid doing this work by hand every time?
- The first step of interpretation is only concerned with EnvE, and yet must be aware of StackE: can we alleviate this pain?

And here you can transition on the scaling from Vellvm: these questions might sound minor, but at the scale of a project like Vellvm, layered interpreters look more like this! And here your message is great, you reemphasize your contribution from slide 2, but a little bit more concretely.

So looking back if I sum up, I feel like for this introductory part, I would upfront the related work, remove slide 4 and 5, but animate slide 6 to make it carry a lot of incremental weight. 

Note: some people were suggesting to move the ltac script improvement upfront. I don't quite see how to sneak it in smoothly but I don't know, maybe it could be good?

Minor note on slide 1 : you can just put "Inria & LIP" for my institution, the stuff in parenthesis is just imposed on the papers for Google Scholar and co to pick things up uniformly.
