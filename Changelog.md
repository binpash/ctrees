0.1 April 2023
==================

Initial release.
This version differs fundamentally from our POPL'23 artifact in that the data structure is parameterized by an arbitrary domain for branches, rather than hardcoding it to arbitrary finite branches.
The POPL artifact will not be released on opam but can be found [here](https://github.com/vellvm/ctrees/tree/popl23), and an extended but unmaintained branch for the simpler, non-parameterized version of the structure can be found [here](https://github.com/vellvm/ctrees/tree/simple).
